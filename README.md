Collaborative Moms Can Code application

We keep saying that we want to do things, but we need a place to do them. This repository can be used by anyone to develop an application collaboratively.

Here are some of the ideas that we have had:
1. See the socials and stay connected: this was an idea to make it easier to stay on top of the SLACK, community, Facebook, etc. 
2. Geolocate other cool people who are working at the same time
